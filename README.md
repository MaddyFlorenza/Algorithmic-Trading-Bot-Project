Algorithmic Trading Bot Project

Nottingham Economics & Finance Society: 

I collaborated in the winning team of 5 people that produced the “Best Performing Algorithmic Trading Strategy”, responsible for the role of a Data Scientist. 

Our strategy utilises PPP, volatility model, and RSI indicators which yielded an average profit of $1.65mil when trading cable (USD/GBP) over a range of periods at varying lengths of time.
