# Algorithmic-Trading-Bot-Project
Algorithmic Trading Bot Competition

Nottingham Economics & Finance Society: 

I collaborated as a part of the winning team of 5 people that produced the “Best Performing Algorithmic Trading Strategy”, responsible for the role of Data Scientist. 

Our strategy utilises PPP, volatility model, and RSI indicators, which yielded an average profit of $1.65mil when trading cable (USD/GBP) over a range of periods at varying lengths of time.
